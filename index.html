<p>As the 21st century dawned, a mare with speed, courage, and durability captured the hearts of racegoers in her native New Zealand, in Australia, and around the world.</p>
<p>Sunline emerged from her Auckland base to become one of the best race mares that New Zealand and Australia has ever seen. She was a cantankerous character who would bite any people who came too close, but she will long be remembered for her deeds on the track.</p>
<p>Sunline was always near the front in her races, inevitably pouring on the pressure with 600 meters to run. At her peak, few horses were able to go with her.</p>
<p>Bred by Susan Archer and Michael Martin, Sunline was leased to trainer Trevor McKee after he had success training Sunline’s family relative Interval, who he co-owned with Thayne Green and Helen Lusty. The lease terms gave McKee, Green, and Lusty a right of purchase for $NZ40,000 – an option they gladly took up shortly into her racing career.</p>
<p>Her list of accomplishments was spectacular. She won 13 group one races, and won five group one races on two occasions, including the W S Cox Plate and the Doncaster Handicap mile.</p>
<p>Sunline also performed well internationally,  beating local champion Fairy King Prawn in the 2000 Hong Kong Mile.</p>
<p>In an astonishing career, Sunline was New Zealand Horse of the Year four times, and Australian Horse of the Year three times – both unmatched.</p>
<p>It was in Hong Kong that she was labeled “the mare of the world”. It was a term she well and truly earned. Few who followed racing at the time will forget her.</p>
